1. Run the entire code (lympho_meta_xmiseq.RMD).
You may face with some errors because the environment of my desktop and yours is different.
You may have to install some packages to run the code properly.

2. If you able to run the entire code successfully, now you should analyze the code chunk by chunk.
Also, you have to compare the code with the content of the paper 
(Predicting Lymph Node Metastasis and Distant Metastasis using Differential Correlations of miRNAs and Their Target RNAs in Cancer), 
and understand the outline of the framewark.
Figure. 1 in the paper will be useful.

*You don't need to analyze the entire functions in the code. But if you want to understand more details, you should.*

*If you have any problem that you can't handle yourself, please ask me.*
